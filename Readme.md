# Ninject mini tutorial

This project implements a simple predator-prey simulation, pitching Ninja against werewolves.

## Ninject stuff 

All ninject bindings can be edited in the respective *Module.cs file in 
the NvW.CompositionRoot project. 

## nvwcl.exe

The nvwcl.exe will only do some minimal setup before jumping into an interactive iron python 
commandline. Have a look at ```__init__.py```.
